# Domain Migration SEO Checklist

## Pre-Migration (CRITICAL)

### 1. Document Current Performance
- [ ] Screenshot current Google Search Console data
- [ ] Export all ranking keywords from GSC
- [ ] Document current traffic levels
- [ ] List all high-value backlinks

### 2. Choose Migration Strategy

#### Option A: Keep Both Domains (RECOMMENDED)
- Keep veogrowth.com as primary
- Use new domain for testing/staging
- No SEO loss

#### Option B: Full Migration with 301 Redirects
- Set up 301 redirects from ALL old URLs to new ones
- Maintain redirects for at least 1 year
- Expect 10-15% traffic loss for 3-6 months

#### Option C: Gradual Migration
- Run both sites temporarily
- Use canonical tags pointing to new domain
- Slowly transition over 3-6 months

## Migration Steps (If Proceeding)

### 1. Technical Setup
- [ ] Set up 301 redirects for EVERY page:
  ```
  veogrowth.com → newdomain.com
  veogrowth.com/about → newdomain.com/about
  veogrowth.com/blog/* → newdomain.com/blog/*
  etc.
  ```

### 2. Update All References
- [ ] Update all internal links in the new site
- [ ] Update sitemap.xml with new domain
- [ ] Update robots.txt
- [ ] Update all schema markup URLs
- [ ] Update canonical URLs

### 3. Google Search Console
- [ ] Add new domain to GSC
- [ ] Submit change of address request
- [ ] Submit new sitemap
- [ ] Monitor for crawl errors

### 4. Update External Properties
- [ ] Google Business Profile
- [ ] Social media profiles
- [ ] Directory listings
- [ ] Email signatures
- [ ] Business cards/materials

### 5. Backlink Outreach
- [ ] Contact high-value sites linking to you
- [ ] Request link updates to new domain
- [ ] Update guest post author bios

## Post-Migration Monitoring

### Week 1-2
- [ ] Daily GSC error checking
- [ ] Verify all redirects working
- [ ] Monitor traffic levels
- [ ] Check indexation status

### Month 1-3
- [ ] Weekly ranking reports
- [ ] Monthly traffic comparison
- [ ] Fix any broken redirects
- [ ] Continue backlink outreach

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. Subdomain Approach
- Use: app.veogrowth.com or landing.veogrowth.com
- Keeps main domain authority
- No SEO loss

### 2. Subfolder Approach
- Use: veogrowth.com/app or veogrowth.com/v2
- Best for SEO preservation
- Inherits domain authority

### 3. Testing Only
- Use new domain for A/B testing
- Keep production on veogrowth.com
- No SEO impact

## Recovery Timeline

If you do migrate:
- **Weeks 1-2**: 20-30% traffic drop (normal)
- **Month 1-3**: Gradual recovery
- **Month 3-6**: Should return to 85-95% of original
- **Month 6+**: Can exceed original if done right

## Recommendation

**For a landing page, I strongly recommend AGAINST changing domains unless absolutely necessary.**

Better alternatives:
1. Use the new domain for testing only
2. Create a subdomain on veogrowth.com
3. Deploy to a subfolder on veogrowth.com
4. Keep both and A/B test

The SEO value you've built is worth preserving!
